                <h2 id="LPL">LoL Pro League - China</h2>
                <p>The LoL Pro League is the top level of professional League of Legends in China. The first season of
                    the
                    LPL was the 2013 Spring season. The top three finishers of the playoff tournament receive automatic
                    bids
                    to the League of Legends World Championship. Playoffs are an eight team single elimination with each
                    step a best-of-five series. The total prize pool is Â¥2,350,000. In 2014 Riot Games began providing
                    an
                    English language broadcast. The format is modeled after the League of Legends Champions Korea format
                    in South Korea. In September 2015 it was announced that Riot Games was in negotiations with Tencent
                    to take over operations of the league.</p>

                <h2 id="LCK">League of Legends Champions - Korea</h2>
                <p>is the primary competition for League of Legends esports in South Korea. Contested by ten teams, the
                    league runs two seasons per year and serves as a direct route to qualification for the annual League
                    of
                    Legends World Championship. The LCK is administered in cooperation between Riot Games and KeSPA.

                    The league was formerly named League of Legends Champions before undergoing a major restructuring in
                    late 2014, which saw a change in the competition's format and a rebranding to its current name. OGN
                    reserved exclusive broadcasting rights of the league until 2016 when rights were split with SPOTV
                    Games. In 2019, Riot Games took over the broadcasting of LCK. <br> <br>

                    The LCK is widely considered to be the strongest League of Legends competition in the world, with
                    the
                    game's World Championship having been won by teams from the league from 2013 through 2017; 2018 was
                    the
                    first season since 2013 where a team from the LCK did not win the World Championship. T1 are the
                    current
                    champions of the LCK, winning their ninth title on 25 April 2020 after beating Gen.G in the finals
                    of
                    the LCK Spring Split 2020.</p>

                <h2 id="LEC">League of Legends European Championship - Europe</h2>
                <p>The League of Legends European Championship (LEC), previously known as the European League of Legends
                    Championship Series (EU LCS), is the name of the professional League of Legends esports league run
                    by Riot Games, in which ten teams compete. Each annual season of play is divided into two splits,
                    spring and summer, both consisting of nine weeks of round-robin tournament play, which then conclude
                    with play-off tournaments between the top six teams. At the end of the season, the winner of the
                    summer split, the team with the most championship points, and the winner of the gauntlet tournament
                    qualify for the annual League of Legends World Championship. The LEC represents the highest level of
                    League of Legends play in Europe. <br><br>

                    With the exception of some touring events, all games of the LEC are played live at Riot Games'
                    studio in Adlershof, Berlin, Germany. In addition to a small studio audience, all games are streamed
                    live in several languages on Twitch, YouTube and Azubu, with broadcasts regularly attracting over
                    300,000 viewers. <br> <br>

                    The popularity and success of the LEC has attracted significant media attention. On 30 September
                    2016, the French Senate unanimously adopted the last version of the Numeric Law, significantly
                    improving the visa process for LEC players and esports athletes in general, giving a legal frame to
                    esports contracts, introducing mechanisms to ensure payment of cash prizes, specifying rights for
                    minor esport athletes, and more. A few months before, France also introduced a new esports
                    federation, "France Esports", which has the duty to be a representative body of esports towards the
                    government and serve as a "partner of the French National Olympic and Sports Committee for all
                    matters relating to the recognition of electronic sports as sport in itself". <br><br>
                    Spain did the same in November 2016, creating the Spanish Federation of Video Games and Esports
                    Spanish Federation of
                    Video Games and Esports. The LEC has attracted sponsorships from Acer Coca-Cola and
                    American Express. <br>
                    Fnatic is the only team remaining that has played in every split since the inaugural 2013 Spring
                    Split.</p>

                    a double-elimination tournament between the top six teams. At the end of the season, the winner,
                    runners-up and third-place team of the summer playoffs qualify for the annual League of Legends
                    World Championship. <br><br>

                    With the exception of some touring events, all games of the LCS are played live at Riot Games'

                    viewers. The U.S. government grants athlete visas for foreign LCS competitors. The first LCS
                    player to be awarded a P visa was Danny "Shiphtur" Le. <br><br>

                    The LCS has attracted sponsorships from Acer Coca-Cola and American Express. "League of Legends
                    Championship Series" is a Delaware limited liability company.</p>
